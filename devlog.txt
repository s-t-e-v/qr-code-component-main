I start this project to give me confidence in doing thougher projects to me.

I created a new branch in git: semantic_html

I will follow the strategy to do semantic markup in the HTML.

I tried as much as I could to not use div and span.

I am now using GIMP to know the size of elements and how there are spaced.

After that, I will follow frontendmentor guidance and beginning with font in the css file

By analysing the layout with Gimp, I can better choose what kind of container and the tag associated should I use in HTML. And I can also see what kind of flex property I should use.

I created a new branch: css style

I begun with including font.
